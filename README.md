Library of scripts for GitScripts, not all of them are made by me.

```Lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erinthian/Scripts/main/GitScripts"))()
```

# Planned features for GitScripts:
* ~~Add Right Click Functionality~~
    * ~~Execute All Scripts in Directory~~
    * Loop Script
    * Viewing/Copying scripts
* Have a dictionary of all of the directories instead of calling the api for each load. Use a refresh button to update the dictionary.
* Allow viewing of more types of files
* Refresh Directory Button
* Script Settings
* Global Search
* Script metadata
